# üìã **AWS Transfer Family ‚Äì CNAME vs NLB Proposal / Decision Matrix**
*(Ready to present to your team or leadership)*

---

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Executive Summary

> **Goal**:  
> To choose the most efficient, reliable, and cost-effective architecture for **AWS Transfer Family (SFTP/FTPS/FTP)** service.  
>  
> **Options evaluated**:
> - **Option 1**: Use **CNAME** + **Route 53** failover  
> - **Option 2**: Use **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** in front of AWS Transfer Family

> **Recommendation** (based on use-case):  
> ‚úîÔ∏è Use **CNAME + Route 53** for simple, cost-effective setups with moderate criticality.  
> ‚úîÔ∏è Use **NLB** when extremely high availability (failover in seconds) and client transparency is required.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture Options

| | **CNAME Only** | **With NLB** |
|:---|:---|
| **Clients Connect To** | `sftp.example.com ‚ûî AWS Transfer Endpoint` | `sftp.example.com ‚ûî NLB ‚ûî AWS Transfer Endpoint` |
| **Health Monitoring** | Route 53 Health Checks | NLB Health Checks |
| **Failover** | DNS-level (slow, TTL based) | Network-level (fast) |
| **Cross-Region Failover** | Easy | Needs multi-NLB setup |
| **Infrastructure Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Security Layers** | AWS Transfer security groups | NLB + AWS Transfer security groups |
| **Advanced Networking (e.g., PrivateLink)** | No | Yes |

---

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Pros and Cons

| | **CNAME Only** | **With NLB** |
|:---|:---|
| **Failover Speed** | 30s ‚Äì 3 mins (DNS TTL dependent) | 5s ‚Äì 30s (instant at connection layer) |
| **Client Impact During Failover** | Clients may need reconnecting | Transparent to clients |
| **Setup Time** | Fast (hours) | Longer (1‚Äì2 days) |
| **Cost** | Very Low | Medium-High |
| **Scalability** | Static | Dynamic (multi-server load balancing) |
| **Operational Complexity** | Very Low | Medium |
| **Cross-region Disaster Recovery** | Easy | Complex (needs DNS + multi-region infra) |
| **Security & Compliance Features** | Basic (SG-based) | Advanced (PrivateLink, flow logs) |
| **Logging & Auditing** | Basic (Transfer Family logs) | Advanced (NLB Access Logs + VPC Logs) |

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Estimate

| Item | **CNAME Only (Monthly)** | **NLB Setup (Monthly)** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| AWS Transfer Family server (1000 sessions/month) | ~$300 | ~$300 |
| Route 53 Hosted Zone + Health Checks | ~$3‚Äì$10 | ~$3‚Äì$10 |
| NLB (per-hour + data) | - | ~$300‚Äì$500 |
| VPC Endpoint (optional for NLB PrivateLink) | - | ~$70‚Äì$100 |
| **Total Estimated Cost** | **~$310‚Äì$320/month** | **~$650‚Äì$900/month** |

*(Note: actual NLB costs vary based on data processed and number of connections)*

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Case Studies

| Company | Solution | Reason |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Financial Services SME | **CNAME Only** | Moderate criticality, acceptable slow failover, cost-sensitive |
| Healthcare Provider | **NLB + Global Accelerator** | Mission-critical transfers, zero downtime requirement, HIPAA compliance |
| Retail Logistics | **CNAME Only** | Infrequent but important file transfers, clients could tolerate DNS re-resolve |
| Telecom B2B APIs | **NLB** | 24x7 high availability, heavy SFTP/FTP upload/download workloads |

---

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation Matrix (Fast View)

| Requirement | Recommended Option |
|:---|:---|
| Low-cost, low traffic | **CNAME Only** |
| Need fast failover (seconds) | **NLB** |
| Clients can't handle DNS changes | **NLB** |
| Multi-region failover | **CNAME (Route 53 failover)** |
| Heavy compliance (audit logs, PrivateLink) | **NLB** |
| Budget-conscious, simple DR plan | **CNAME Only** |

# 8Ô∏è‚É£ Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|
| Slow failover using CNAME (TTL caching) | Set TTL to 30 seconds; educate clients on reconnect behavior |
| Higher cost using NLB | Budget approval needed; optimize data flow through NLB |
| DNS caching by FTP/SFTP clients | Implement client-side reconnection retries or reduce TTL |

| Decision Criteria | Weight | CNAME Score | NLB Score |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Cost | 40% | 10 | 5 |
| Failover Speed | 30% | 5 | 10 |
| Complexity to Maintain | 20% | 10 | 6 |

# üéØ Conclusion

‚úîÔ∏è **Choose CNAME Only** if you want simple, budget-friendly, low-failure impact architecture.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Choose NLB** if you need fast failover, seamless client experience, higher traffic handling, or additional security layers.
